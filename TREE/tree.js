// tree is  a hirarcheal data structure that consist of node connected by edges
// no-leniear data structure

// tree is non-linear nature allow quicker and easier acess to the data


// degeree of a node- The total count of subtrees attached to that node is called the degree of the node.
// degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the nodes in the tree.

// The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node.
// Each edge adds 1 unit of length to the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root of the tree to the node.
// depth of a root node is always 0

// HEIGHT

// Height of a node: The height of a node can be defined as the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.
// Height of the Tree: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.

// types of tree

//  In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two children linked to it. Some common types of binary trees include full binary trees, complete binary trees, balanced binary trees, and degenerate or pathological binary trees.
